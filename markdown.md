### **Section 10: Markdown**

- Markup language like LaTeX, XML, or HTML to easily distinguish between tags and text
- But can be rendered as web page or pdf
- Microsoft Office or Google Docs are wysiwyg (what you see is what you get). While it is comfortable for writing, it is not geared toward adding in-line code or tags.
- Markdown is sort of in between where you have tags but you also have wysiwyg environment that is very readable and writer friendly but you have the ability to add formatting, code snippets and links.

The editor that I recommend is [Typora](https://typora.io/) to write markdown files.
