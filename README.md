# HPC 101 webinar

### Section 1

To get started, Windows users need to first install [Git Bash](https://git-for-windows.github.io/).

- Follow the prompts
- Select "Use Git from the Windows Command Prompt"
- Select "Checkout Windows-style, commit Unix-style line endings"
- Select "Use Windows' default console window"
- Finish

After Git Bash is installed, launch Git Bash that will open a Command Prompt window. 



To get started, Mac users open a Terminal. To open a Terminal, press `command` + `space`, then type `term` and press `enter`. The Terminal window will pop up. You can customize your Terminal, by clicking on Terminal -> Preferencesâ€¦ (or alternatively, press `command` + `,`) to open up Preferences. There you can choose a profile that you like (make that Default to open up new Terminal window with that profile). 

In the Git Bash window (Windows) or Terminal (Mac) , type:

```
$ pwd
```

The command `pwd` stands for print working directory and it will display where you are in the directory structure.

To navigate to the directory where you would like the HPC tutorial repository to be. Use `cd` (change directory) command to move into a different directory. The `cd` command switches you into the directory that you specify, like so:

```
$ cd <directory name>
```

Type the command `ls` (list directory contents) this will show you what files are in your current working directory.
